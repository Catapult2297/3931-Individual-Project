# Rust Code Logic Analyzer

## Overview

The Rust Code Logic Analyzer is a tool designed to analyze Rust programs for logical errors and verify their correctness using automatic program verification techniques.

## Features

- **Code Parsing**: Parses Rust source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- **Logical Analysis**: Identifies common logical errors, such as uninitialized variables and incorrect conditionals.
- **Automated Verification**: Integrates formal verification techniques to ensure code correctness.
- **Reporting**: Generates reports detailing findings and suggestions.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.XX or higher
- `Cargo` (Rust's package manager and build system)
