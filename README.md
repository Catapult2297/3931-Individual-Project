# Hoare Logic Proof Assistance

## Overview
Hoare Logic Proof Assistance is a tool designed to analyse programmes for logical errors and assist programmers during development.
This proof assistance will focus specifically on basic data types and control flow, rather than attempting to fully verify large codebases.
The goal is to provide useful insights that help developers catch common issues early in the development process.

## Features

- **First-Order Logic**: Parses Fist-Order Logic as precondition and postcondition.
- **Hoare Logic Rules**: Builds Hoare Triple for deduction.
- **Verification**: Integrates formal verification techniques and allows human expert to ensure code correctness.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.XX or higher
- `Cargo` (Rust's package manager and build system)
